Como o nosso modelo precisa resolver um problema muito sensível em que o nível de acertos ou erros pode custar uma vida, é necessário utilizar esta métrica em conjunto com outras para determinar quão bem o modelo está performando ou qual o melhor modelo a ser escolhido.\n",

        "A curva ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) mostra visualmente o limiar da relação entre falsos positivos e verdadeiro positivos do modelo. Quanto mais alto o limiar, maior é a taxa de verdadeiro positivo (TP) e também maior será a taxa de falso positivo (FP). \n",
        "\n",
        "No hipotético caso extremo em que todos os exemplos são colocados na classe positiva, vemos que ambas as taxas chegam a 100%, enquanto no outro extremo, ambas ficam em 0%. É por isso que, quanto mais próxima a curva estiver do canto superior esquerdo, melhor é a predição do modelo, considerando que ele teria 100% de TPR e 0% de FPR. A linha tracejada serve como uma base de comparação, ela representa qual seria a curva de um classificador que prevê classes de forma aleatória.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uma métrica muito popular e também utilizada neste projeto é o AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve), ou ROC AUC score, que calcula a área sob a curva ROC para medir o desempenho do modelo.\n",
        "\n",
        "Por que usá-la? ROC AUC score é muito bom pra calcular o desempenho do modelo em fazer predições, é indicado quando os dados são bem balanceados, e também deve ser utilizado quando as classes positivas e negativas são igualmente importantes, o que é o nosso caso. É de extrema importância que o nosso modelo seja capaz de prever corretamente tanto quem vai para a UTI, quanto quem não vai para a UTI. Não queremos que um paciente receba alta e mais tarde volte em uma condição muito crítica e até mesmo vindo a falecer por um erro de previsão. O inverso também é relevante, porque não queremos disperdiçar recursos com um paciente que não necessitará de UTI, mas que por um erro do modelo foi classificado como um paciente positivo para UTI, desperdiçando recursos preciosos do hospital."

        "Entre todos os modelos selecionados e testados com diferentes configurações, escolhi os modelos que usam os algoritmos LGBMClassifier e XGBClassifier com a função de seleção de features, RemoverCorrVar ou SelectFromModel. A escolha dos hiperparâmetros e até mesmo dos modelos em si foram feitas ustilizando o software de automação de configuração de modelos de machine learning, hyperopt-sklearn, que seleciona os melhores algoritmos e parâmetros baseado em testes estatísticos. Ele funciona como um pipenline de classificação em que reúne, os dados, preprocessamento, entre outros parâmetros para avaliar qual seria o melhor modelo e configuração de hiperparâmetros a serem utilizados pelo cientista de dados. O uso desta ferramenta auxiliou bastante o processo de criação e configuração dos nossos modelos de classificação binária, ajudando a ganhar tempo e ao mesmo tempo automatizando em parte o processo.\n",
